# Graduation Cap Spring 2022 :zap:

## **Description**
This upcoming May, I will be graduating with my **Master of Science in Computer Engineering** from [The University of Texas at El Paso](https://www.utep.edu/engineering/ece/index.html)! Therefore, I decided to create a custom graduation cap to decorate as a true *engineer*. The graduation cap will utlize ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller with addtional sensors, LEDs, and NFC to store data.

## **Firmware**

  - [x] LEDs
  - [x] ADLX335
  - [x] Lithium battery
  - [x] RP2040 custom board
- [x] Developed schematic
- [x] Developed printed circuit board
- [x] Board layout 4.74" * 4.74" with 45 degree rotation
